# logic-shaper

Develop your logical thinking skills by solving programming puzzles based on shapes. Write the code for the algorithms that can answer the questions below.

## Based on three different shapes with different colors. 

### Easy

* How many circles are there on the screen?
* How many squares are on the screen?
* How many orange shapes are there?
* How many green squares are there?

### Intermediate

* Are there more squares that circles on the screen?
* Hide all the green circles on the screen.
* Which color shape occurs the most?
* Are there more orange than blue squares?
* Which colored shapes occurs an even number of times?

### Hard

Return:

* all the color and shape combinations that occurs an uneven number of times
* any color that has more than three shapes in that color
* any color that has more shapes than others


## How it will work

Create an API that sends the question and dataset to use to the client.
The client should send back the answer to the API.
The system should keep track of the questions completed by a client.
